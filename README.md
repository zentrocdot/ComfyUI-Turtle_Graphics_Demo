# ComfyUI Turtle Graphics Demo

## Get Started

Turtle Graphics has some interesting features. This nodes makes use of these features. The goal is to show
how Turtle Graphics can be used to create beautiful square graphics.

This node is for demonstration purposes but one can use this node for some interesting things. One example
is the creation of colorful QR codes. 

It will explained later how Turtle Graphics works. It has to be noted that Turtle Graphics makes use of Tkinter.
In variations of this nodes one can think about different cases where Turtle Graphics or/and Tkinter can be used.

Step by step some more demos to the existing ones will be added. The settings will result in a broader range of
graphics. 

As part of the development I could show that it us not necessary to save and load a Turtle Graphics for later
use. The canvas can be streamt so it can be used as Pil image.

The background of a Turtle Graphics image is by default white. This is right independent from the background 
of the screen where the graphics is drawn. By use of Jumpy this white background can be removed with a 
background of personal choice.

If the background is exchanged by a black background it us also possible to remove the background.

To be cont'd
